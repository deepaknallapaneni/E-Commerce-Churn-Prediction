# E-Commerce-Churn-Prediction
This project aims to predict customer churn in an e-commerce platform using machine learning techniques. Unlike traditional models that rely solely on transactional data, this approach incorporates a variety of customer attributes, including demographics, shopping preferences, and satisfaction scores, to improve churn prediction accuracy.
